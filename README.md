 I made a quiz about JavaScript using JavaScript to help my friends and I revise some of the JavaScript and jQuery concepts.   Built using jQuery, the quiz consists of multiple - choice questions, each with four answer choices. For every correct answer, the score is 10 and for every wrong answer the score is -10.
 
 Tools used: HTML5, CSS3, jQuery.
